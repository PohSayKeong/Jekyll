    <p>Hi, my name is Poh Say Keong and I am currently a 14-year-old student in Singapore.</p>

<p>I am pretty new to coding and I hope I can contribute as much as possible to the various open source projects in <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/?hl=en">Google Code-In</a></p>

<p>I am currently working with FOSSASIA and the mentors have been extremely helpful when I face challenges.</p>

<p>Hi friends, it's Say Keong here.
<br><br>I am a 14 year old from Singapore and although I am quite into tech, I am pretty new to coding and this experience has really been an eye-opener for me. Honestly, when I looking for my first task, I was pretty lost because there were just so many tasks to choose from and I was really just trying to find something manageable for me.
<br><br>My first task was to create a themed webpage using a webmaker tool called "Thimble", although it was just a beginner task, I struggled a little there as well. Shout out to Diva,saptaks,Gauthamraj and Harsh Vardhan for guiding me through the task... and yeah I had 4 mentors helping me at the same time. 
<br><br>After I completed my first task, I was confident enough to set eyes on my first project that I wanted to work on.
The one that interested me was the Open Event Webapp. As I am pretty new to coding I couldn't really help much, I only created two basic manifest files for Firefox OS and Chrome OS. I messed around with some AngularJS as well, but that was about it. I really hoped I could contribute more to that project, but my current coding skills really limits me.
<br><br>Then,another project surfaced on the tasks menu, I was probably the first to have worked on that project together with my mentor and I really took it as an honour. I was working on Flappy-SVG with Nicco Kunzmann. I was designing some background and character using Inkscape as a starter, and I could remember I had to redo my background twice because I duplicated my shapes instead of cloning them which increased the line count in the SVG file significantly,a lesson learnt. But overall, it was fine.
<br><br>However,since the project was still very new, there were no functions to switch the character or background. I was really passionate about the project since I could really do my part in contributing, I didn't want to give up then, so I went ahead and claimed the task. Although, I ran into many problems when I was trying to make my code work, Nicco really helped me a lot and I was able to complete that series of tasks smoothly.
<br><br>After that, I moved on to other tasks as I wanted more people to work on this project together and not just the two of us. This was my favourite project among those that I had seen and I really hope I can continue to contribute to this project in the future.
<br><br>Next, I was working on more individual tasks, like some simple Android app development, building some webapp with NodeJS and making use of databases. I did some blogs using Hugo and Jekyll as well, that was definitely and enriching experience for me.
<br><br>Soon after, the new year began and school started for me so I really wasn't able to spend as much time on GCI as I hoped to after that
<br><br>Although, I was not so interested in Loklak at first as I felt that I was unable to do most of the tasks due to my coding incompetency, eventually I decided to give it a try as it was one of the major projects people were working on. I struggled a little during the setup process but thanks to Sudheesh Singanamalla for his help, I managed to complete the setup.
<br><br>Since I was not so good with coding and due to my school work, I did not manage to contribute to the Loklak project itself, but I did went on to make some screencast videos on the setup process locally as well as the setup process with Docker, as I did with some other projects.
<br><br>As I was not so good with coding, I decided to help some of my friends to get involved instead. Some of them only managed to complete one task but some of them were enthusiastic enough to do more and get to know more about the community.
<br><br>After all that, the most important thing I learned in this contest is that anyone can contribute to the open source community regardless of how good his or her coding skills are. Hence I genuinely urge young teens to join GCI next year to really be exposed to such activities.
<br><br>I feel that the mentors really did a great job in this GCI and if there is one thing I hope can be improved on, I hope that perhaps the mentors can help in facilitating some students to work together which can help us foster new friendships as well.
<br><br>As my coding skils are not very good now, I would first work on that and every once in a while I will check back to see what FOSSASIA is up to and see how I could help. Since I am Singapore, I had already submitted my volunteer form for the FOSSASIA event here later in March and really hope that I can contribute as much as possible.
<br><br>Lastly, I really want to say thank you to all the mentors that have helped me throughout this GCI journey. Thanks!</p>
